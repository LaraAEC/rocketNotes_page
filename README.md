An easy-to-use and highly useful application for the daily life of anyone and/or professional. With it, the user can quickly access their Notes containing important links they want to use in their routine.
Its purpose is to record all the user's favorite links so that when they access the application with their login and password, a list of Notes containing their title (subject) and corresponding tags is shown to the user. They can click on these Notes and access their complete description and saved links.
Tags are used to facilitate the search for registered Notes through tags. Searches can also be done by title.
This frontend application is full of carefully crafted pages to consume the backend API, efficiently handling all HTTP Protocol transactions, sending requests, receiving responses, and rendering these responses in the interface.
Its color palette is refined with an excellent sense of style, making it extremely pleasant for users to access this Notes Application in their routine.
